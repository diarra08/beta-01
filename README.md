Since we had a large amount of inscriptions, you have to go through this final selection step.  
But don't worry, even if you aren't selected to this beta, this won't affect your chances to be a student.

**Beta sessions are simply test phases for us & the school, this is not the official selection process**

We need you to be **fully available** during the whole week (monday to sunday), if not, please let someone else do the beta.

To validate your entry, create a github account if you don't have one already and [make an issue](https://github.com/nan-ci/beta-01/issues/new) containing your email

Please fill those requirements, otherwise your issue will be rejected:
- You may not add more than one email per issue
- Make sure to use the same email you used to register the Beta (the email where you received these instructions)

We will finally send a confirmation to the emails from the first 15 **correct** issues.

Good luck!
